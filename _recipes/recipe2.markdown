# Baked Banana & Blueberry Oatmeal

I know some people find oatmeal a bit unusual however I cannot recommend this recipe more! I love the yummy fruit combination and hint of cinnamon. You can always swap out the toppings if you fancy mixing up the flavours.   

This recipe is vegetarian and vegan friendly. Oats are packed full of antioxidants and fibre, they are also incredibly filling and provide slow releasing energy.

- Handful of blueberries

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180c, fan setting.
2. Place the oats in a bowl and cover with boiling water, just so the top is covered - soak for 10 minutes, until soft.
3. While the oats are soaking, mash one of the bananas and slice the other into pieces.
4. Crush the walnuts into bite-sized chunks.
5. Once the oats have absorbed the water and become soft, stir through the mashed banana, chopped walnuts, maple syrup, cinnamon, blueberries, sunflower seeds, almond milk and raisins.
6. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and place the pieces of sliced banana on top.
7. Cook for 20 minutes, until golden.
