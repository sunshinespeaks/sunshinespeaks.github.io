## Ingredients

## For the Potatoes:
- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 14 cherry tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar
- 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
- 200g of black beans, drained
- Pinch of fresh coriander, chopped
- ½ a teaspoon of chipotle powder
- 1 teaspoon of brown miso paste
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper

## For the Sour Cream:
- 200g natural yogurt (I use coconut yogurt)
- 1 tablespoon of tahini
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste

## For the Guacamole:
- 2 avocados, peeled and pitted
- Juice of half a lime
- Handful of fresh coriander
- ½ a red chilli
- 10 sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped


## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200c, fan setting.
2. Wash the sweet potatoes, pierce the skin with a fork a few times and then bake for 60-70 minutes until cooked through.
3. While the potatoes cook, peel and finely chop the garlic, quarter the cherry tomatoes and heat both in a pan with a glug of olive oil. Add the beans, chipotle, apple cider vinegar, miso and salt and pepper and cook for 10 minutes on a gentle heat. Roughly chop and stir in the coriander, then take off the heat.
4. To make the sour cream, simply mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl until smooth.
5. For the guacamole, scoop the flesh out the avocados and mash it with a fork. Finely chop the chilli and coriander then mix into the avocado flesh along with the lime and salt and pepper and sun-dried tomatoes.
6. When the sweet potatoes are cooked, remove from the oven and cut them in half. Scoop out the middle and mix 2/3 of it into the beans and tomatoes, then scoop spoonfuls back into the potato skins.
7. Serve the loaded sweet potato skins with big spoonfuls of cool guacamole and sour cream on top.
