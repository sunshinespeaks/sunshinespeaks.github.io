## Ingredients

- 55g almond meal (ground almonds)
- 50g unrefined raw sugar
- 2 tablespoons of finely chopped crystallised ginger
- 1 tablespoon of ground linseed meal (ground flaxseed or brown linseed meal) If you cannot find pre-ground linseed meal you can grind linseed or flaxseed yourself in a coffee grinder or blender
- 70g of buckwheat flour
- 35g fine brown rice flour
- 2 tablespoons of organic cornflour
- 2 tablespoons of gluten-free baking powder
- ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon of ground ginger
- A pinch of fine sea salt
- 136g of finely sliced rhubarb
- 1 small apple, peeled, cored and finely diced
- 95ml of rice or almond milk
- 60ml of olive oil
- A large free-range egg
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


## Method

1.	Preheat oven to 180C/ 350C. Grease or line eight muffin cup tins with paper cases.
2.	Place almond meal, sugar, linseed meal into a medium sized bowl.
3.	Sieve the flours, baking power and spices into the bowl and whisk to combine.
4.	Stir in the rhubarb and apple to coat in the flour mixture.
5.	In a smaller bowl whisk milk, oil, egg and the vanilla extract between pouring into the dry mixture and stirring until all mixtures are combined.
6.	Evenly divide the batter between the tins/ paper-cases and you can always scatter with extra rhubarb if desired.
7.	Bake for 20-25 minutes or until fully risen and golden around the edges. If a skewer is entered into the middle of the muffins it should come away clean.
8.	Remove from the oven and set aside on a cooling rack for around 5 minutes. Then remove the muffins once the tray has cooled sufficiently and place muffins on the cooling rack.
9.	Eat & enjoy warm or at room temperature! Best to store in an airtight contain for no more than 3-4 days. You can always keep frozen in zip-lock bags for longer.
