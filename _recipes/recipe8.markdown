# Salmon & Zesty Asian Slaw

Fresh, bright and zingy, this salad ticks every box. This recipe works great for a dinner or a speedy lunchtime recipe. The cabbage or nut type can always be swapped out depending on your preference.

-	Salmon is high in vitamin B and contains tonnes of omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon is also a great anti-inflammatory meat alternative. However if you are feeling a veggie meal, simple cut out the fish however if salmon isn't to your liking then other meat alternatives work just as well.

## Ingredients

- ¼ small red cabbage
- 2 salmon fillet, uncooked
- 2 squeezes lime juice
- 3 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 2 large carrots
- ½ apple
- 4 tbsp edamame beans
- 2 sprinkles of sesame seeds

## For the Dressing:
- 2cm piece of ginger
- Juice and zest ½ lime
- ¼ small red chilli, diced
- 2 tsp sesame oil

## Method

1. Make the dressing by grating the ginger and lime zest into a large bowl. Add the chilli and sesame oil and a squeeze of lime juice. Stir everything together and set aside.
2. Chop the tip off the red cabbage and take off the outer layer. Thinly slice the cabbage until you have a generous handful of strips and gently scrunch them to soften. Add these to the ginger dressing.
3. Place the salmon in a shallow microwaveable dish. Add a squeeze of lime juice and sprinkle with some salt and pepper. Pour in enough cold water to reach halfway up the fish and add the white wine vinegar. Cover with a plate or some clingfilm and microwave on high for three minutes.
4. Next, grate the carrot and apple into the bowl with the cabbage. Use your hands to toss the salad and set aside.
5. Take the salmon out of the microwave and check to see that it has cooked through. If not, put it back in the microwave for 30 seconds and check again. Be careful not to overcook it as it will dry out.
6. Once cooked, add the salmon to the bowl with the slaw and top with the edamame beans and a sprinkling of sesame seeds.
