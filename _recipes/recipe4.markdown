## Ingredients

## Turkey Burgers:
- 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 sweet onion, minced
- 1 egg
- Handful of roughly chopped parsley
- ½ teaspoon of dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon of red-pepper flakes
- 450g of ground turkey (turkey mince)
- 100g of bread crumbs
- Salt and pepper for seasoning

## Tzatziki Dip:
- 130g of Greek yoghurt
- ½ a cucumber, diced.
- 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons of lemon juice
- 1 pinch pf garlic powder
- Salt and pepper
- Handful of roughly chopped parsley

## Burger Toppings:
- 4 whole-wheat hamburger buns, gluten-free buns OR lettuce wrapped
- ½ red onion
- 8 lettuce leaves
- 2 tomatoes, sliced
- Avocado (sliced or mashed)



## Method

1.	Make the Turkey Burgers: In a small pan heat the olive oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook until tender, 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute. Set aside to cool to room temperature.  
2.	In a medium sized bowl, mix the cooled onion mixture with the egg, parsley, oregano, red-pepper flakes and ground turkey. Add the bread crumb and season with salt and pepper. Mix until combined.
3.	Preheat the oven to 190C/ 375F. Make the meat mixture into patties of equal size. Heat an oven-safe pan over a medium to high heat and spray with a non-stick cooking spray if possible.
4.	Place the burgers into the pan and sear on each side until well browned, 4-5 minutes per side. Move the pan to the oven and cook until the burgers are fully cooked through, around 15 minutes.
5.	Make the Tzatziki dip: In a medium bowl, mix the yoghurt and cucumber, olive oil, lemon juice and garlic powder to combine. Then season with salt and pepper and stir in the parsley.
6.	Make toppings: Place each burger on the bottom half of the bun and top each with as much tzatziki as you desire, 1-2 lettuce leaves, tomato slices and the top half of the bun. Serve Immediately. Enjoy!
