## Ingredients

- 2 scoop vanilla protein powder
- 4 cups almond milk
- 2-4 steamed or roasted medium beets
- 3 tablespoons almond butter/cashew butter
- ½ cup frozen chopped zucchini or cauliflower
- Juice of half a lemon (about 2 tablespoons juice)

## Method

1. Simply combine all the ingredients in a blender (works best in Nutribullet style blenders to really blend everything properly) and blend until thick and creamy.
2. You may adjust for your desired thickness by adding ice or removing liquid — the opposite is true if you prefer it thinner.
3. Feel free to add more ingredients or switch up any existing ingredients to suit your tastes.
