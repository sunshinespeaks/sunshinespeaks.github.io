Let’s be honest winter time is the saddest time of the year, we all take for granted how sunlight (or lack thereof) can significantly affect our mood. As people we need regular fresh air and sunlight to feel and perform at our best and during winter months, honestly, it’s just hard to find the motivation to go outside and brave the freezing cold temperatures just to get our “recommended” daily sunshine intake. It’s not just the ramblings of the likes of me – it’s scientifically proven, there’s even a name for it – S.A.D (Season Affective Disorder).

How can we battle these blues I hear you ask?!
1.	Well – venturing outdoors is an obvious one. The lack of light and shorter days can make this extremely difficult, especially if you are not a particularly outdoorsy type. However fresh air is extremely important, even if it’s just a quick walk round the block. Every little helps!

2.	Keep up the exercise – again, because of the shorter, darker and colder days, it’s really easy to get home, switch on netflix and binge watch multiple series before going to sleep. NO – exercise is important to help prevent winter blues and keep fit and healthy despite the depressing weather. This can be done outdoors or (if you’re not up to the weather) try and indoor home workout. These are just as effective and it’s a great way to get in your 15-minute hit session before a chilled evening of Netflix – remember all in moderation!

3.	Try out a lightbox – I have never tried one – nor am I any sort of expert and cannot comment on their effectiveness - saying that, I have only heard good things. But I can imagine waking up to a happy natural light rather than pure darkness would feel like pure bliss during cold winter months.  

4.	Make exciting plans – try to avoid hibernating during cold months and get out and about. Making exciting, new plans can only help to motivate you to avoid the sofa or your bed and instead be around people enjoying new experiences. Inside, outside – whatever is easiest but socialising during these miserable months can only help bring up your mood.

5.	Let in the light! Any opportunity to let in the sun when you are stuck indoors is crucial! Take advantage of any sunny days by being outdoors or if this isn’t an option, opening the curtains and blinds and letting in the light if you have to be stuck indoors.
