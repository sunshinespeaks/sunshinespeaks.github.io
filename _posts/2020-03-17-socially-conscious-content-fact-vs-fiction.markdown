Consumers are not only looking to purchase social and environmentally conscious products but also relatable content. In an industry where content is sold purely to make profit it is important to remember that there are publishing organisations out there who offer an alternative, not-for-profit approach to journalism and publishing. 

The New Internationalist is an international non-profit organisation that aims to publish content that other magazines and publishing companies choose to “sidestep” as well as provide alternative perspectives to global issues. The New Internationalist covers topics such as; the climate, democracy, economics, technology, human rights, migration, minorities and war & peace. It is so important to support companies such as the New Internationalist by purchasing such published content in order to educate oneself of worldwide issues and news that other outlets do not necessarily shine a light on, both nationally and internationally.

In today's society it is increasingly hard to cut through all the noise online and social media and decipher fact from fiction with the ever-increasing idea of “fake news”. The New Internationalist’s approach to journalism helps to produce credible and reliable content that informs and educates rather than twist or fabricate a story for profit-based purposes. Undoubtably, it is becoming harder to understand fact and fiction but also truth and opinion. The advances in social media and digital publishing mean that it is much easier to publish opinion and spread ideologies worldwide within seconds, that is not necessarily relevant or factual, making it increasingly easy to mistake opinion- based content for a factual representation of an event or idea. 

People are seeking knowledge and credible news formats over the everyday, invasive unreliable gossip news, blogs and magazines. There has been a decrease in popularity of catchy headlines and instead a steady rise in demand for journalists offering trustworthy, non-biased, balanced and honest reporting. Perhaps this is due to the reliance society has on the digital media to report on day-to-day worldwide news, expose lies, hold governments, politicians and institutions to account for wrong doings and strive for a more informed, well balanced and equal society.
