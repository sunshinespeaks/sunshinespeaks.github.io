Over the last two years podcast popularity has grew to new heights. Audiobook and podcast style consumption rose by 43% in 2017-2018 as publishers are recognising the need to branch out and penetrate new markets. Publishers such as Harper Collins and Penguin Random House have adopted their own in-house podcasts that allow readers to read books as well as listen and get to know their authors. In line with the theme of positive and progressive blogging it is important to highlight the supply and demand for an increasing genre of uplifting podcasts that are becoming available. 

There are so many amazing new podcasts available to purchase and for free that are both upbeat and relaxing to listen to if you’ve had a busy stressful day at home or at work and are looking for something, light-hearted or funny to prepare you for a chilled evening.

Following on for Fearne Cotton’s top 10 best selling book Happy Place has subsequently led onto the release of her also very popular podcast. Fearne’s podcasts introduces a new voice every week, usually some form of celebrity, to discuss how to beat the blues and cherish and enjoy everyday as it comes. Life can be extremely stressful and there are so many pressures that come with everyday fast paced life, if you are feel stressed and in need of reminding of how to park the stress and unwind, this is great podcast to help you do just that. Unlock your inner happiness!

Another amazing podcasts to listen to after a long day is the podcast How to Fail by Elizabeth Day. This podcast is amazing for simply celebrating anything that has gone shockingly wrong! Instead of looking on these instances negatively she opens up a discussion with her guests allowing successful business owners alike to talk about all thing’s failure. 
Another lovely podcast is the amazing Happy Mum Happy Baby by Giovanna Fletcher, based on her bestselling book. This podcast is extremely lovely, expanding on the discussion of all thing’s motherhood. This podcast is both extremely frank but also warm and welcoming, with a back and forth discussion with her podcast guests. This is great for all mothers as it discusses both the highs and lows and often helps to put minds at ease. She supports championing what you have and not comparing yourself or your parenting to others. 

There are some incredible British comedy podcasts. If you are simply looking for a no-brainer laugh then look no further than the My Dad Wrote a Porno comedy podcast featuring three key voices; Jamie Morton, James Cooper and Alice Levine or the amazing Adam Buxton in his hilariously funny The Adam Buxton Show podcast.

Lastly but most certainly not least, check out the Power Hour by Adrienne Herbert. This podcast is amazingly motivational and it's sole purpose is to push you to pursue your passion and achieve success!  

If you are looking for an uplifting, happy, positive or hilarious podcast then I fully recommend – often a much cheaper alternative to purchasing a book or eBook and you get just as much content from each and every episode.
