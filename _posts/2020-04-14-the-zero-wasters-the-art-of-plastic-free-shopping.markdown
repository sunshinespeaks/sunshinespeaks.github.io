More and more people are discovering and understanding the detrimental effects plastic waste has on our environment, seas and wildlife. Consequently, more people are looking for quick and easy alternatives in order to cut back on their plastic usage or eradicate it altogether in order to do their bit in helping save the planet and live in a more natural, litter free environment. 

There are so many ways to make easy changes to your everyday life and essentials in order to cut back on plastic. There are many interesting and useful blogs, websites and books that offer guidance in living a more sustainable life. If you are looking to attempt to do this, I recommend checking out Kathryn Kellogg’s’ blog, Going Zero waste, she explains everything there is to know, as well as recommends other sources of information regarding going zero waste and offers her own knowledge of swapping out items for more sustainable products. The book How to save the world for free by Natalie Fee is another great way to explore alternative ways to live a more clean and sustainable life. 

However, if you already are trying to adopt a zero-waste life but are looking for a variety of places to purchase products that allow you to do this then look no further. I have attempted to make a list of shops selling a variety of products that are promoting plastic free living. However, sadly local to me (Oxfordshire) there are fewer shops like this that are also fairly reasonably priced. There are numerous organic fruit and vegetable plastic free food shops, including a section within Waitrose itself however for many these are not sustainable money-wise.

**The Market Garden – Witney:** The market garden is an organic shop within Eynsham, Witney. They offer a variety of food products in plastic free, particularly; rice, cereals, pastas, oils, vinegars, flour, nuts, fruit and dried fruit and many more. During this time of isolation, they are still trading after 4pm using contactless payments only (no cash) and are also available for deliveries. 

**Objects of Use – Oxford:** This store does pretty much what it says on the tin. The shop is attempting to recycle used and unused items and products that are useful in everyday household chores and activities. Instead of buying kitchen and tableware for your local supermarket, why not explore what shops like Objects of Use have to offer as you are likely to be recycling and purchasing plastic free products. 

**Oxford Soap Co. – Oxford:** Oxford Soap Company offer fantastic plastic free and deliciously smelling products. If you are looking to swap out your plastic squeezy soap bottles, or your endless body washes and shampoos and conditioners then look no further. Their soaps are not only plastic free but extremely luxurious and high-quality.
