Born and raised in England, with a passion for healthy, holistic lifestyles. I am currently in my **final** year studying a BA in Publishing Media at Oxford Brookes University.   

On Sunshine Speaks you will find a variety of weekly blog posts covering interesting topics, topical issues and probably some of my random interests... Enjoy!

In addition to the weekly blog discussions you will also find a section on new recipe ideas aimed at offering you more holistic alternatives. These have been developed overtime by personal experiences and aim to help offer delicious healthy, anti-inflammatory and organic alternatives to your regular everyday snacks, drinks and meals. These are perfect if you are suffering from illnesses and are looking to alter your diet in addition to or instead of potentially prescribed medicines or even if you are looking to live a cleaner more healthy life.
